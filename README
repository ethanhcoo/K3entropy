Some added Functionality to Curt McMullen's 'ORBITS OF AUTOMORPHISMS OF K3 SURFACES, Version 3.2 3/2006'
Most of this ReadMe is a regurgitation of his ReadMe.

QUICKSTART.
Starting in example or src folders.
To execute './Mclass.run' type
cd ..; cd src; make; cd ..; cd example; ./Mclass.run
Same for other .run files

THEORY.  A K3 surface S in R^3 is specified by the equation

(1+x^2)(1+y^2)(1+z^2) + Axyz = B .

In many files, we set $A = 10$, $B = 2$.

Each line parallel to the x, y or z axis meets S in 2
points, so we obtain 3 involutions by "sheet interchange".
These maps preserves a natural volume element on S.

Set f = Iz Iy Ix;

PROGRAMS.  This directory contains 5 programs:

	periodicExact 
		- Verifies a particular delta-pseudo orbit using the MPHR library
	derivativesExact 
		- Gives derivative information the specific pseudoOrbit above using MPHR library.
	paths  
		- Input: a periodic point and its period 
		- Output: image path data (see paths for a description)
	mclass	
		- Input: image path data
		- Output: Mapping class of f, up to reflection, in terms of dehn half-twists
	Periodic 
		- Experimentation only; useful for finding recurrent orbits
	Derivatives 
		- Experimentation only; gives derivative information along an orbit without using MPHR library



STABLE INPUT.  All input to stable is via command-line arguments.

-b	Draw only bottom of surface.  By default the surface is
	transparent.

-c [x y] -r [r]
	Set window for image by giving center and "radius".
	Default is center (0,0), radius 1.2.

-e [eps]
	Set the accurancy of the stable manifold plot. 
	The manifold is drawn as a series of line segments each
	of length about eps.

-l [L]
	Continue extending the stable manifold until the
	path joining p to f(p) has length > L.

-p [A B]
	Change the parameters for the surface S.

-q	Quiet.

-s	Spin surface (draw image under (xyz) -> (yzx))

-t	Draw only top of surface

EXAMPLES.  See the example/ directory for usage.

TROUBLESHOOTING

IF: 'path length exceeded N'
THEN: increase eps, increase MaxPathlength
