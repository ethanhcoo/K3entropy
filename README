Some added Functionality to Curt McMullen's 'ORBITS OF AUTOMORPHISMS OF K3 SURFACES, Version 3.2 3/2006'
Much of this ReadMe is a regurgitation of his ReadMe.

See his program for instructions on how to use "Traj" and "Stable." 

QUICKSTART.
Type "cd src; make" to install,
then "cd ../example; ./Traj.run; ./Stable.run" to test.

THEORY.  A K3 surface S in R^3 is specified by the equation

(1+x^2)(1+y^2)(1+z^2) + Axyz = B .

Each line parallel to the x, y or z axis meets S in 2
points, so we obtain 3 involutions by "sheet interchange".
These maps preserves a natural volume element on S.

Set f = Iz Iy Ix Iz Iy Ix;

PROGRAMS.  This directory contains 4 programs:
	mclass	- 
	paths  - 
	periodic - finds almost-periodic points using minimal guaranteed accuracy 


STABLE INPUT.  All input to stable is via command-line arguments.

-b	Draw only bottom of surface.  By default the surface is
	transparent.

-c [x y] -r [r]
	Set window for image by giving center and "radius".
	Default is center (0,0), radius 1.2.

-e [eps]
	Set the accurancy of the stable manifold plot. 
	The manifold is drawn as a series of line segments each
	of length about eps.

-l [L]
	Continue extending the stable manifold until the
	path joining p to f(p) has length > L.

-p [A B]
	Change the parameters for the surface S.

-q	Quiet.

-s	Spin surface (draw image under (xyz) -> (yzx))

-t	Draw only top of surface

EXAMPLES.  See the example/ directory for usage.
